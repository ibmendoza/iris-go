  Iris Go binding
===================

This is the official Go language binding for the Iris cloud messaging framework. If you are unfamiliar with Iris, please read the next introductory section. It contains a short summary, as well as some valuable pointers on where you can discover more.

  Background
-------------------

Iris is an attempt at bringing the simplicity and elegance of cloud computing to the application layer. Consumer clouds provide unlimited virtual machines at the click of a button, but leaves it to developer to wire them together. Iris ensures that you can forget about networking challenges and instead focus on solving your own domain problems.

It is a completely decentralized messaging solution for simplifying the design and implementation of cloud services. Among others, Iris features zero-configuration (i.e. start it up and it will do its magic), semantic addressing (i.e. application use textual names to address each other), clusters as units (i.e. automatic load balancing between apps of the same name) and perfect secrecy (i.e. all network traffic is encrypted).

You can find further infos on the [Iris website](http://iris.karalabe.com) and details of the above features in the [core concepts](http://iris.karalabe.com/book/core_concepts) section of [the book of Iris](http://iris.karalabe.com/book). For the scientifically inclined, a small collection of [papers](http://iris.karalabe.com/papers) is also available featuring Iris. Lastly, slides and videos of previously given public talks are published in the [talks](http://iris.karalabe.com/talks) section.

There is a growing community on Twitter [@iriscmf](https://twitter.com/iriscmf), Google groups [project-iris](https://groups.google.com/group/project-iris) and GitHub [project-iris](https://github.com/project-iris).

  Installation
----------------

To get the package, execute:

    go get gopkg.in/project-iris/iris-go.v1

To import this package, add the following line to your code:

    import "gopkg.in/project-iris/iris-go.v1"

Refer to it as _iris_.

  Quickstart
--------------

The first step to using Iris through any binding is setting up a local _relay_ _node_ through which messages can be sent to any participant of the system. You can find detailed infos in the [Run, Forrest, Run](http://iris.karalabe.com/book/run_forrest_run) section of [the book of Iris](http://iris.karalabe.com/book), but a very simple way would be to start a _developer_ node.

    > iris -dev
    Entering developer mode
    Generating random RSA key... done.
    Generating random network name... done.

    2014/06/13 18:13:47 main: booting iris overlay...
    2014/06/13 18:13:47 scribe: booting with id 369650985814.
    2014/06/13 18:13:57 main: iris overlay converged with 0 remote connections.
    2014/06/13 18:13:57 main: booting relay service...
    2014/06/13 18:13:57 main: iris successfully booted, listening on port 55555.

Since it generates random credentials, a developer node will not be able to connect with other nodes in the network. However, it provides a quick solution to start developing without needing to configure a network name and associated access key. Should you wish to interconnect multiple nodes, please provide the `-net` and `-rsa` flags.

### Attaching to the relay

### Messaging through Iris

### Additional goodies

A demo presentation is also available, touching on all the features of the library through a handful of challenges and their solutions. The recommended version is the [playground](http://play.iris.karalabe.com/talks/binds/go.slide), containing modifiable and executable code snippets. A [read only version](http://iris.karalabe.com/talks/binds/go.slide) is also available.

  Contributions
-----------------

Currently my development aims are to stabilize the project and its language bindings. Hence, although I'm open and very happy for any and all contributions, the most valuable ones are tests, benchmarks and actual binding usage to reach a high enough quality.

Due to the already significant complexity of the project (Iris in general), I kindly ask anyone willing to pinch in to first file an [issue](https://github.com/project-iris/iris-go/issues) with their plans to achieve a best possible integration :).
